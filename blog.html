        In today’s fast-paced world, many of us don’t have the time or energy to cook healthy meals—let alone connect with others in a meaningful way. That’s where <strong>Zestli</strong> comes in. We’re proud to introduce an app that not only delivers delicious food to your doorstep, but also delivers something even more important: human connection.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Every Zestli order comes with a carefully curated meal and a handwritten note. Whether it’s encouragement from someone who’s been where you are, a thoughtful quote, or a simple “You got this!” from a stranger—these small messages remind us that we’re not alone.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        We’ve worked closely with chefs and counselors to design meals that are both nourishing and comforting. Whether you’re a student missing home, a busy professional, or someone just needing a moment of kindness - Zestli is here for you.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Our team believes food can be more than fuel. It can be a bridge, a gesture, a warm hug when no one is around. That’s why Zestli isn’t just a food delivery app. It’s a movement to bring care back into everyday routines.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        The app is now available on both the App Store and Google Play. Try it out, send a meal with a note to someone you love or to yourself. Because we all deserve to feel seen, fed, and cared for.
